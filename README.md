### Create flashcards, study them, and learn more with Brainiac!


#### Currently working on: foundation of site, codebase, and more.

<p>
 Considering using a tech stack that includes JavaScript/TypeScript, React, and Redux for the frontend. Then, using Python/Flask for the backend that will communicate with a PostgreSQL database. My goal here is to use familiar tech stack that can also accompany some important React components for future implementation including animations, and a parallax effect for the landing page, about page, and possibly dev information or something.
</p>
Coming soon!
