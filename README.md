### Create flashcards, study them, and learn more with Brainiac!


#### Currently working on: foundation of site, codebase, and more.

<p>
Current Stack Includes:
 <ul>
  <li>JavaScript, React, and Redux for the frontend with the goal of utilizing Reactjs-card-flip package to make clean, smooth user experience with flippable cards.</li>
  <li>Also, going to utilize Bulma CSS framework as I want to utilize a different framework than a conventional tailwindcss.</li>
  <li>Python and Flask for a lightweight API that I can build from the ground up with everything I need and potential to add more depending on needs of the backend.</li>
  <li>PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, and Alembic for the database and Pythonic SQL queries to read and write concurrently with little to no hassle involved.</li>
  <li>Current deployment plans include Render.com and eventually utilizing Docker to containerize.</li>
 </ul>
</p>


More coming soon!
